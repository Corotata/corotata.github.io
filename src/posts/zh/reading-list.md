## Books I'm Reading

Reading is a huge part of my life. Here are some books I've enjoyed recently:

1. **The Design of Everyday Things** by Don Norman
2. **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin
3. **Steve Jobs** by Walter Isaacson

> "Stay hungry, stay foolish."

### Why Read?

Reading helps me disconnect from the screen and reconnect with deeper ideas. It's the fuel for my creativity.
