## Welcome!

This is my first blog post on my new portfolio website. I built this blog using **React**, **Vite**, and **Markdown**.

### Why I built this?

I wanted a place to share my journey as an iOS developer. I plan to write about:

- Swift and SwiftUI tips
- Design patterns
- App marketing strategies
- And a bit of my personal life

Stay tuned for more!

```swift
func hello() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```
